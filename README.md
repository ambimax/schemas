## Introduction

This repository contains schemas for data validation. All schemas inside the ```public``` folder are available at https://schemas.ambimax.de/.


## Adding a schema

To add a schema, simply commit them in a new branch inside the public folder. They will be available when merged to master.

The folder structure should make sense. One convention would be to put them into ```public/[context]/[year]/[month]/[schema].json```.
